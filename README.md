# Network Adapter Switcher

nadap-switch, short for Network Adapter Switcher, is a lightweight Windows utility that lets you quickly switch between all available physical network adapters—right from the system tray, with just one click.

> **Why?**
>
> I work in IT and often need to switch between Wi-Fi and LAN. This usually means disabling or enabling the respective adapter through Control Panel, running PowerShell scripts, or manually disconnecting, this becomes quit infuriating if you have to do it more frequently through out the day.
>
> So, the solution: nadap-switch.

## Features

- Instantly switch between all available physical network adapters
- Option to run at startup for quick access
- Clean, tray-based interface with simple controls

⚠️ **Note**: When you select a single adapter (e.g., Wi-Fi), all other network adapters are automatically disabled. You can re-enable them manually via Command Prompt if needed.

## Usage

- Download `nadap-switch.exe` from the [releases](https://github.com/arlbibek/nadap-switch/releases/latest)
- Run the application
- Right-click the tray icon to view and switch between adapters
