# Network Adapter Switcher

nadp-switch, short for Network Adapter Switcher, is a lightweight Windows utility that lets you quickly switch between all available physical network adapters—right from the system tray, with just one click.

> **Why?**
>
> I work in IT and often need to switch between Wi-Fi and LAN. This usually means disabling or enabling the respective adapter through Control Panel, running PowerShell scripts, or manually disconnecting, this becomes quit infuriating if you have to do it more frequently through out the day.
>
> So, the solution: nadp-switch.
